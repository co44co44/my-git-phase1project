# Name: 
MyMallHelper

# Description: 
MyMallHelper is an app that helps shoppers who are visiting a Mall, to find the store(s) at that same mall, where the item they are looking for is being sold. 
The app will return to the user: the items available at the mall that matched their search, the name(s) of the store(s) where it is sold, the product details (size, color, gender), and their store location at the current Mall.  It will also allow the user to click on their favorite item to recognize them while he shops.

# Story of this app: 
 Shoppers at a mall can waste a lot of time looking for an item.  It is exhausting and requires a lot of effort and energy because of not knowing where to go to find what they are looking for.  This app wants to help shoppers find the item they need, by provinding them the store name, details and location where their item is being sold. 

# Audience:
Shoppers at an specific Mall. At the moment, the App shows Sawgrass Mills.  
This first first version of the app will mock the Sawgrass Mills Mall at Sunrise-Florida. 

# Server:
In the future, the data used will be the data from the online stores that are physically at those malls. However, for this project on phase-1, a jb.json file is being used.  This file contains the data that the user will access. I used real pictures and data from two main stores: GAP (https://www.gap.com/) and OLD NAVY (https://oldnavy.gap.com/)

# Part of the data at the db.json file, including images, was obtained from:
https://oldnavy.gap.com/
https://www.gap.com/


# Future additions:
- The app will have more dropdowns which will be chained, so the user can use more categories. 
- I will add a button that when clicked, it will take to user to the stores' location in a live map.   
- This app will do scrapping for using the websites' servers on the stores at the malls to retrieve data (instead of the db.json file).
- This app will have more searching options (Dropdowns) available when it is connected to the server.  
-The State and the Mall are setup by default for this project, this will change on future phases where I will be able to add their live location.  This app will find the user location, so it will automatically select the mall.

Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
