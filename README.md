# Name: 
MyMallHelper

# Description: 
MyMallHelper is an app that helps shoppers who are visiting a Mall, to find the store(s) at that same mall, where the item they are looking for is being sold. 
The app will return to the user: the items available at the mall that matched their search, the name(s) of the store(s) where it is sold, the product details (size, color, gender), and their store location at the current Mall.  It will also allow the user to click on their favorite item to recognize them while he shops.

# Story of this app: 
 Shoppers at a mall can waste a lot of time looking for an item.  It is exhausting and requires a lot of effort and energy because of not knowing where to go to find what they are looking for.  This app wants to help shoppers find the item they need, by provinding them the store name, details and location where their item is being sold. 

# Audience:
Shoppers at an specific Mall. At the moment, the App shows Sawgrass Mills.  
This first first version of the app will mock the Sawgrass Mills Mall at Sunrise-Florida. 

# Server:
In the future, the data used will be the data from the online stores that are physically at those malls. However, for this project on phase-1, a jb.json file is being used.  This file contains the data that the user will access. I used real pictures and data from two main stores: GAP (https://www.gap.com/) and OLD NAVY (https://oldnavy.gap.com/)

# Part of the data at the db.json file, including images, was obtained from:
https://oldnavy.gap.com/
https://www.gap.com/


# Future additions:
- The app will have more dropdowns which will be chained, so the user can use more categories. 
- I will add a button that when clicked, it will take to user to the stores' location in a live map.   
- This app will do scrapping for using the websites' servers on the stores at the malls to retrieve data (instead of the db.json file).
- This app will have more searching options (Dropdowns) available when it is connected to the server.  
-The State and the Mall are setup by default for this project, this will change on future phases where I will be able to add their live location.  This app will find the user location, so it will automatically select the mall.
